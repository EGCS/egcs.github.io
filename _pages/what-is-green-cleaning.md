	<div class="entry">
		<p>Cleaning products are a major contributor to indoor air quality issues in closed environments. Many contain various toxic chemicals, some of which have high levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which can give rise to respiratory irritation, headaches and other symptoms.<br />
The purpose of &#8216;going green&#8217; is to address human illnesses that arise from exposure as well as damage to the environment (water, soil, air) from disposal of products we use every day.</p>
<p>EGCS uses all Shaklee products. Basic G is effective against disease causing organisms including Canine Parvovirus, Filine Leukemia, Ringworm, HIV-1, Feline Picorna virus and infectious Bronchitis virus and many others. Basic G (germicide) will last up to 3 days after application as opposed to 1 hour effectiveness for chlorine bleach. It also kills mold and mildew. Most of all it is completely safe for animals, you and the environment.</p>
